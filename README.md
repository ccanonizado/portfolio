Welcome to my first personal website. This is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I would like to thank Brittany Chiang for the inspiration. Her [v4 portfolio](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) is amazing and that is where I got the idea to make a portfolio of my own. :smiley:

## My plans

As I progress in the industry and improve my skills, I hope to create better portfolios, just like what Brittany does. With that, I will try to make a new one every year or so.

## By the way

This portfolio is not yet finished. I plan to do other things such as SEO. Also, if I happen to finish new projects this year then I will add it here immediately. :+1:

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to inform me. Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you!
